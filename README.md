E-commerce platforms provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes and due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms is essential.  This command-line application is the back-end of an e-commerce website using the latest technologies, which allows you to create a database using MySQL and connect to the database using Sequelize.  After the schema and seed commands are run, and the database is populated with test data for categories, products, and tags; the API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are checked in Insomnia, with the ability to create, update, and delete data in the database.
